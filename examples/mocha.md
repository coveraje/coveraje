### How to see coverage reults for mocha

To see how much the [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) tests cover the mocha code, copy the file `mocha_coveraje` into the `test` folder of mocha, go to this folder and run the new file.

On linux you need to make it executable by using `chmod`.

    ./mocha_coveraje

Alternatively you can use

    node mocha_coveraje

instead (that's the way it works on Windows, too).
